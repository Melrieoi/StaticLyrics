Guessed:

Gather at my feet, innocent children
These warning I beg you to take heed
Leeding calls as I whisper, you know
These secrets that the devils try to keep

Life is just a foolish game oh child
We play by the rules just to go another round
And we cry we will lose and we say the rules seem so unkind
And ... is the price for the fool who has followed the rules when deaths forces ?crown?

Now theres another secret to remember
I read it in the writing on the wall
There's a whisper of truth in everything
There is bitterness in the lies your father told

It may be revealed for only a moment and quickly it fades away
Like teardrops on the spiders web before the morning ?gold?

(Raise your) Raise your hands lift high your voice
(Death is) Death is ... rejoice
(...) Hell is on the right ... just to keep, keep our children now
Oh seize youself and be redeemed

Oh life is a losing game
Try and fail, laugh an whail
Up and down and round and round
And we cry we will lose and we say the rules, the rules just seem so unkind

And a little bit away at the dawn of the day
When there's nothing to say cause your dead in the ground
Our corpses, our vessels, our spirits will alight
Naked and nervous in the ruins of fading light

In flesh ?abissals?
The meaning ?will ?rise?
No heaven, just hell
In the ruins of fading light

Our corpses, our vessels, our spirits will alight
Naked and nervous in the ruins of fading light

In flesh ?abissals?
The meaning ?will ?rise?
No heaven, just hell
In the ruins of fading light

Corpses, flesh vessels, our spirits will take flight
No heaven just hell
The ruins, the ruins of fading light

This flesh ?abissals?
And you search for the truth to alight
There's no heaven
In the ruins of fading light rage on
