Guessed:

Looked in the shadow
A moonlit night
Silent figures beckon through the pool
...

The bones of the holy
Underfoot is hallowed ground
But something is pulling me closer
And i'm starting to reach out my hand

My heart beats against the blade
I enter a darkend room
I know I should be more afraid
But I have come back for you

Specters are watching
I can feel their unholy gase
Thirteen black candles in the dark
Echo the angels, and the four watchtowers

But can you hear the beating of my heart
The portal is starting to open
The key is the nineteenth call

The swadows begin to sway
A strange light is filling the room
I know I should be more afraid
But I have come back for you

I have heard the cries calling from the other side of the Scrying Orb
As fire cleaves the sky I am feeling so alive in the Scrying Orb
There is thunder in our hearts there are answers in the eye of the Scrying Orb
We are demons in the dark we are angels in the light of the Scrying Orb

The swadows begin to sway
A strange light is filling the room
I know I should be more afraid
But I have come back for you

I have heard the cries calling from the other side of the Scrying Orb
As fire cleaves the sky I am feeling so alive in the Scrying Orb
There is thunder in our hearts there are answers in the eye of the Scrying Orb
We are demons in the dark we are angels in the light of the Scrying Orb
