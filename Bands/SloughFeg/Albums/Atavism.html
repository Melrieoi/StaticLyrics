Released from the bondage
Bloodlust is turned to knowledge
I will kill you
Return into the carnage

Sentient forms have risen
Time is an endless prison
You will die
I'll become cold and wizened

You know your place in history
Are you denying I am free?
Any prophet of this new dark age can see

Rise from the tomb of millions
Crawl to become reptilian
I will kill you

Like those who came before you
Life never ceased to bore you
You will die
History will ignore you

Then you'll engage in sophistry
Why can't you handle being free?
Another victim of a slaughter prophecy

You know your place in history
Are you denying I am free?
Any prophet of this new dark age can see

No need for ritual slaughter
Bow to the crest of martyrs
You will evolve
But not getting any smarter

You think the truth will set you free
While you're denying what you see
Any prophet of this new dark age can see
                </pre>

Decending and turning the shadowed souls in his hand
Standing alone by the guadrian I hear his command
Swaying blindly, under a moribund sun
Strangely the pain has only begun

Painlessly crossing the yardlines the ball in his hand
Piles of bodies dispached in the grass and the sand
Helmets crashing, under the weight of the one
Vaguely aware the pain has begun

Out of the window the sirens of slaughter begin
Whistling alone in the silence I hear them come in
Fading blinded, foraging under the leaves
Strangely the pain is finally relieved
                </pre>

Twelve heards on the mainland shore
Gathering slaughter I wait
I'll bring you my finest (paw?)
Driving the drones to their fate
I'm a swineherd awaiting my masters
Return from the city of (try?)

The anger of gods increase
Slaughering cattle to burn
The baiting of hounds won't ciece
Long for their master they yearn
-?Soon as we'll fall to the hand of my master upon his triumphant return?

The ?insulence? soon disposed
Carelessly stalking their prey
I'm ?raging? the islands coast
Searching my mind far away

I'm a swineherd impatiently waiting
To spill your blood on the day / The spalial bloon on the day
