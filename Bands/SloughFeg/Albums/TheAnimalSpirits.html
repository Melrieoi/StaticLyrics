You should have seen him
Lying alone in helpless silence in the night
You should have seen him
You would have seen his eye reflecting in the light

So for the old man
Ashes to ashes, earth to earth and dust to dust
No one will see me
No one with guilt to share, no secret soul to trust

And he won't be found at all
Not a trace to mark his fall
Nor a stain upon the wall

Louder and louder
Till I could tell the sound was not within my ears
And you should have seen me
You would have seen my eyes grow wide and cold with fear

Heard all the things in Heaven and Earth
I've seen many things in Hell
But his vulture's eye of a cold pale blue
It's the eye of the Devil himself

Take me away now
But let the silence drown the beating of his heart
I can't go on
Let me be free from this wretched secret that I carry
Please set me free
                </pre>
