                <pre>
Hard bony limbs covered in leathered skin
Behind his eyes with the rage of ten warped men
Without a sound he steals right through the night
The sign of death to him brings grim delight
Those marked for death can feel him coming near
Some stand in fight and some just cry in fear
On a horse black, the dark lord takes to flight
But no one forgets the Highlander rode tonight

(x2)
Can't you hear his call
The Mightiest will fall
He will control your destiny
Many mortal screams out of agony
The Highlander has come for me

(approx)
We all see him kneel, after the ... ... fathers
Those who died on the field of battle, ... (grunt/shout)
Yes slay 500 noble men and did not need to many, no (NO!)
(approx)

There's no white spell to best this Earth Pig born
Against his kind an eternal oath was sworn
All kinds of men will fall beneath his blade
Women and children, the choice it has been made
You see him fighting across the field
Some Stand and fight and some just cry in fear
On a horse black, the dark lord takes to flight
But no one forgets the Highlander rode tonight
                </pre>
