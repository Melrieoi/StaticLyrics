Down and out on the Solomani Rim
Now the spinward marches don't look so grim

I hear the X-boats on my trail
Engines always on the run

I'm mercenary, live in hyper-drive
Traders and Gunboats keeping me alive

On route to Pscias always on the run
Busted in the Sword-Worlds with a loaded Gauss-Gun

I hear the X-boats on my trail
Engines always on the run

(approx)
The Sword-Worlds are a loose confederation of worlds
all colonised in the same era

Through the centuries their relationship has varied from 
fledgeling empires to scattered trading packs

At the spinward edge 120 parsecs
from the original center of the Empirium

The Martians represent one of the furthest
extensive exploration in the Zodani consulate and Vargr extents
(approx)

Down and out on the Solomani Rim
Now the spinward marches don't look so grim

On route to Pscias always on the run
Busted in the Sword-Worlds with a loaded Gauss-Gun (Gauss-Gun)

I hear the X-boats on my trail
Engines always on the run
                </pre>
