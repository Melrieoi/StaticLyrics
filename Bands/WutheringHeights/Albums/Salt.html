Guessed:

If this is the end then what was it all worth?
Don't bother to ask there's no price on this earth
Cause life's still a mistery, you can't cost-benefit analyse it
And the ?hereafter? songs in our minds so we try to disguise it
Still it shall be exiting to see, the end of the show
Abramacabra baby, here we go

The meaning of life? Well I don't really care
For this could be the last time we come up for air
And maybe there's really no reason to stay
Still I play you a shanty to brighten your day

Cry out when they pull the plug on this world oh mechanic
?A dream to get to play? on the deck of this last titanic

I will dance on the gunwale as the ship's going down
I will write no solemn epitaphs for a world that's gone insane
When there is no tomorrow even then will I know
That as long as the mistrels are playing
All is not in vein

Maybe the meaning was lost on the way
Maybe we've achored at the last bay
Now we'll not loose spirit, but it may not be sound
So crack open the barrels if we're really going down

?Riots and the lights go out lord oh the vanished/banished?
They begged to be set free by the mad sailor that they banished

I will dance on the gunwale as the ship's going down
I will write no solemn epitaphs for a world that's gone insane
When there is no tomorrow even then will I know
That as long as the mistrels are playing
All is not in vein

I will welcome the gods in the ?depths of our? war
Stand up as they fire the first round
I'll have peace of mind, when the new day will find
No consequese ... dust on the ground
And I'll be as dead as the rest and it would not mean a thing
Misantropoetica, allow me this last fling

Liar ?then they cry?: freak absurd and manic
But when this ship turns upside down these rats will panic

The weight of the world, proved much to tough
Just getting myself by along was more than enough
But remember my words like marks from a whip
This old salt will go down with his ship

I will dance on the gunwale as the ship's going down
We will write no solemn epitaphs for a world that's gone insane

I will dance on the gunwale as the ship's going down
I will write no solemn epitaphs for a world that's gone insane
When there is no tomorrow even then will I know
That as long as the mistrels are playing
All is not in vein
