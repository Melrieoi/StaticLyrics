Guessed:

I'm freezing, i'm cold
I've fallen into this dark hole(?)
Lights out in darkness my fears unfold

Drowning winds of no meaning
Through the night I am screaming
Throw me a rope to hold

Empty is the crystal ball
Stare into empty ... i'll
Fall if I can ride ... if I can brush the hills
... man was glowing (?)
... to be wasting time

Only a spark
A spark so swift Too Great Thy Gift

I know now a mighty powers granted me this light
... a heavy load
Lost in this pantemime
I can scream, but no one will hear me
If I could only believe

Empty is the crystal ball
Stare into empty ... i'll
Fall if I can ride ... if I can brush the hills
... man was glowing (?)
... to be wasting time

Only a spark
A spark so swift Too Great Thy Gift

The madman standing on the hill
I'm hearing the laughs and sky cries (?)
You will give me mine
I hail you I curse you, and I cry

Give me an answer
How should I know
Which way to go?

?
Though the roads ahead
To doubt for this pending
Stalling till death
In fear of this ending
?

Empty are my heart and soul
And my fear is growing
If I can ride ... if I can brush the hills
... man was glowing (?)
... to be wasting time

Only a spark
A spark so swift Too Great Thy Gift

If I can ride ... if I can brush the hills
... man was glowing (?)
... to be wasting time

Only a spark
A spark so swift
A spark so swift
Too Great Thy Gift
